/**
 * Your table will use quadratic probing to resolve collisions, with the quadratic function (n^2+ n)/2 to compute the step size. 
 * The hash table must use a contiguous physical structure (array). The initial size of the table will be 1024, and the table will
 * resize itself automatically, by doubling its size whenever the table becomes 70% full.
 * Since the specified table sizes given above are powers of 2, an empty slot will always be found unless the table is full.
 * You will use the elfhash() function from the course notes, and apply it to the concatenation of the feature name and state
 * (abbreviation) field of the data records. Precisely how you form the concatenation is up to you.
